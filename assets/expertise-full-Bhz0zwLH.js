              <p>
                I create high-performance, responsive web solutions with a “right-tool-for-the-job” approach.
                For simple projects, I write clean, efficient HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                For complex, SEO-focused business sites and portfolios, I use Next.js to deliver scalable, production-ready web experiences.
                My solutions are built to rank well, convert visitors, and remain reliable, maintainable, and easy to update.

              <p>
                I engineer dynamic web applications designed to solve complex functional problems. Specializing in React and Angular, I build everything from interactive dashboards and internal tools to robust customer-facing products. My focus is on clean architecture, ensuring that state management and performance remain seamless as the product grows. I deliver maintainable, "clean-code" solutions that prioritize intuitive user experiences and long-term flexibility.

                I develop specialized tools that empower traders and investors to automate their workflows and data analysis. Whether it’s tracking portfolios, backtesting strategies, or setting real-time alerts, I bridge the gap between platforms. By integrating Excel and Google Sheets with custom web apps, I create automated systems that sync market data and eliminate manual entry. You describe your strategy; I turn it into a streamlined, high-accuracy solution tailored to your edge.
